# CodePup Frontend Documentation

## Overview

CodePup is a frontend application for an AI-powered website generation platform. It provides a seamless user experience for creating websites through natural language prompts. The application follows a conversation-based workflow where users can describe their requirements, review design proposals, and iterate until the final website is generated. The platform supports both frontend-only and full-stack application generation.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Motion** for animations
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Clerk** for authentication
- **Axios** for API requests
- **Drizzle ORM** for database interactions

## Core Features

1. **Conversational UI**: Users interact with the AI in a chat-like interface
2. **Project Types**: Support for both frontend-only and full-stack applications
3. **Design Preview**: Visualization of design choices before generation
4. **Live Streaming**: Real-time code generation with visual feedback
5. **Project Management**: Creation, listing, and modification of projects
6. **Deployment Integration**: Automatic deployment of generated websites

## Application Architecture

The application follows a modern React architecture with the following key components:

### Main Pages

1. **Index Page** (`src/pages/Index.tsx`): 
   - Landing page with project selection/creation
   - Design workflow for gathering requirements
   - Project listing and management

2. **Chat Page** (`src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`):
   - Main interaction page for code generation
   - Split layout with chat interface and preview
   - Real-time code streaming visualization

### Key Components

1. **Project Type Selector** (`src/components/options.tsx`):
   - Allows users to choose between frontend-only or full-stack projects
   - UI cards with feature descriptions

2. **Design Preview** (`src/pages/design-preview.tsx`):
   - Expandable preview of design choices
   - Color palette visualization
   - Responsive design mockups

3. **Streaming Code Display** (`src/pages/streaming.tsx`):
   - Real-time visualization of code generation
   - File completion tracking
   - Progress indicators

### State Management & Logic

The application uses React hooks for state management:

1. **Chat Page Hooks** (`src/hooks/chatpage_hooks.ts`):
   - `useChatPageState`: Manages all chat page state
   - `useChatPageLogic`: Contains business logic for chat interactions
   - Handles streaming, workflows, and API interactions

2. **Context API** (`src/context/FrontendStructureContext.tsx`):
   - Provides application-wide state for frontend structure
   - Enables component communication

## User Workflows

### 1. Website Creation Workflow

1. **Initial Prompt**:
   - User enters a description of their desired website
   - Optionally uploads reference images

2. **Project Type Selection**:
   - User chooses between frontend-only or full-stack

3. **Design Process**:
   - AI analyzes requirements and proposes design choices
   - User can provide feedback and iterate on design
   - Design preview shows color scheme, layout, and features

4. **Code Generation**:
   - Once design is finalized, user triggers code generation
   - Real-time streaming of code generation process
   - Progress visualization with file completion tracking

5. **Deployment**:
   - Automatic deployment of the generated website
   - Preview URL provided to user

### 2. Website Modification Workflow

1. **Select Existing Project**:
   - User selects a previously created project

2. **Describe Changes**:
   - User describes desired modifications in natural language

3. **Live Modification**:
   - AI understands and implements requested changes
   - Updated code is generated and deployed
   - New preview URL is provided

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Captured in React state via controlled components
2. **API Requests**: Sent to backend using Axios
3. **Streaming Responses**: Processed via Fetch API with stream handling
4. **Real-time Updates**: Rendered through React state updates
5. **File Parsing**: StreamingCodeParser processes incoming code chunks
6. **Visualization**: Dynamic UI updates based on streaming progress

## Key API Endpoints (Frontend Perspective)

The frontend interacts with these backend endpoints:

1. **Project Management**:
   - `GET /api/projects/user/:id` - Get user's projects
   - `POST /api/projects` - Create new project
   - `GET /api/projects/:id` - Get project details
   - `DELETE /api/projects/:id` - Delete project

2. **Design Process**:
   - `POST /api/design/analyze` - Analyze user prompt
   - `POST /api/design/feedback` - Process user feedback
   - `POST /api/design/generate` - Generate design files

3. **Code Generation**:
   - `POST /api/design/generateFrontendOnly` - Generate frontend code
   - `POST /api/design/generate-frontend` - Generate fullstack code
   - `POST /api/design/plan-structure` - Plan application structure

4. **Modification**:
   - `POST /api/modify/stream` - Stream code modifications

## UI/UX Components

### Main UI Sections

1. **Landing Page**:
   - Project creation prompt
   - Project listing
   - Authentication controls

2. **Chat Interface**:
   - Message history
   - Input area
   - Workflow status indicators

3. **Preview Section**:
   - Live website preview
   - Code streaming display
   - File generation progress
